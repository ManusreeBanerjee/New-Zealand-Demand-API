# New-Zealand-Demand-API
For this industry project, the task was to build a demand model for the New Zealand Government Public Health administrator. The model must be based on private hospital discharge records. This was an end to end project where the assessment was not merely based on the model but the entire application(s). To that effect, a User Interface had to be created that allows a Government Public Health administrator to input parameter values in the application(s) which will populate or retrieve updated output.

Objectives: Research - Which data sources can best be used to inform the New Zealand Government Public Health Official? Which are the most interesting? Which are the most adequately insightful? Start to think about the demographic NZ Gov PH official is reaching and how those users can engage with the application(s), etc.

Predictive Analytics Integration - How will predictions fit into the application? What will those predictions look like? How will the user interact with them? Think about building personas, performing customer research and structuring user stories, then move on to wireframing and building the UX of the Capstone Industry-Project lab..

Design Document & Proposal - Once youâ€™ve decided what the application will be, how will it work? What technologies will you use? How will you get, transform, store data? How will that data get to machine learning/predictive model tool(s)? What will be the user flows to interact with the application? A user flow diagram could be useful in addition to marketing plans for launch and how to gain audience engagement and conversions.

Build - Once your design and proposal are approved, how will you show incremental progress? How will you respond to feedback?

QA - How will you assure you have covered edge cases and made an application that is reliable?

Deliver - The deliverable for this project is a URL linking to the web application you have built.

Random Forest Regressor was chosen to be integrated into the API owing to its least RMSE. Individualised discharge date prediction based on age, sex, ICD 10 code and district derived fom admission date and mean length of stay.
